        <p class="paragraph">
            Before 2021, college athletes in the United States faced significant challenges when it came to securing financial support or finding sponsorships. The stringent NIL (Name, Image, and Likeness) restrictions imposed by the NCAA (National Collegiate Athletic Association) prevented them from benefiting financially from their talent and reputation. However, with recent changes in legislation across many states, college athletes now have the opportunity to receive compensation from their supporters and seek sponsorships to enhance their personal brands. Despite these positive legal developments, our research revealed a critical gap in the market. There was no dedicated platform to assist college athletes in promoting themselves and establishing valuable sponsorship connections. While well-funded companies could easily identify and sponsor talented athletes, the same opportunities were not readily available to individual athletes. This is where SponsorIn comes in.
